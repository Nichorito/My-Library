MY LIBRARY

This is my intermediate javascript library; completed as a part of the Odin Project

The main purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use javascripts
constructors, prototypes, and objects, as well as their related functions such as

Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)
obj.prototype
obj.hasOwnProperty('property name')
obj.valueOf() ////// Outputs object key : value pairs
obj.prototype.something = function() {} // Creates a new property

Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype) 
///// Makes player inherit from person
